# artclassmicro
Deploys art class links for you!

How to use?
Download main.py and run it :0
If there's a problem, this is probably why:
1) You don't have python downloaded
2) You don't have pip and the packages downloaded (pip install pyautogui)
3) You use a browser that doesn't use ctrl+n to open tabs, or ctrl+w to close them! Just use chrome weirdo
4) My code sucks :(
If this doesn't help, dm me on discord: ggnewo

Vercel please don't kill me :)
